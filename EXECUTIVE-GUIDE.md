## FAQ

**Q: Why only daily, not real-time?**
A: Designed for executive briefings, not crisis response. Daily is sufficient for situational awareness.

**Q: Why is it public on the internet?**
A: All data comes from public news feeds anyway. System adds no new information—just curates what's public.

**Q: What if I miss a day?**
A: Dashboard always shows today's data. Previous days are overwritten (no history stored).

**Q: Can I download the data?**
A: Yes, it's `data.json` – your IT can provide it.

**Q: Who has access?**
A: Anyone with the link. No login required (as requested—zero authentication).
